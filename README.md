This is code that I came up with which allows me to use discord to talk to a characterai character as long as the bot is up and running.
I made it primarily for my own use case however feel free to use it as you like.

please refer to [kramcat's documentation](https://github.com/kramcat/CharacterAI) to get your characterai api tokens needed to run the program.
